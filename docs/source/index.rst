NEMS is the Neural Encoding Model System. It is helpful for fitting a
mathematical model to time series data, plotting the model predictions,
and comparing the predictive accuracy of multiple models. We use it to
develop and test `computational models of how sound is encoded in the
brains of behaving mammals <https://hearingbrain.org/research.php>`_,
but it will work with many different types of timeseries data.

Documentation for the previous iteration of NEMS can be found at
