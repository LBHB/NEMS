# All data should be loaded as 2D numpy arrays. We leave this step up to
# individual users, since data formats are so variable. Built-in model layers
# (see `nems.layers`) expect time to be represented on the first axis, and
# other data dimensions (neurons, spectral channels, etc.) to be represented on
# subsequent axes. For example, spiking responses from a population of neurons
# should have shape (T, N) where T is the number of time bins and N is the
# number of neurons. State data (like pupil size) should have shape (T, M) where
# M is the number of state variables.
# NOTE: shape (S, T, N), where S is the number of samples/trials, is also
#       supported through optional arguments, but that is not covered here.
# TODO: add a separate tutorial covering batched optimization, point to it here.

# as an additional model input, so we can specify `pupil_size` as state data.

# By default, `scipy.optimize.minimize` will be used for optimization
# (which can also be specified using the `backend` parameter). This also tells
# the model to use each Layer's standard `evaluate` method for transforming
# inputs (whereas `backend='tf'`, for example, would use
# `Layer.as_tensorflow_layer()`). See `nems.models.base.Model.fit` for
# additional fitting options.

# Predict the response to the inputs using the fitted model.
prediction = state_fit.predict(spectrogram, state=pupil_size)


# Instead of specifying a custom model, we can also use a pre-built model.
# In this case we've also specified `output_name`. Now the output of any
# layer that doesn't specify an output name will be called 'pred' instead
# of the default, 'output'. Our standard LN_STRF model only needs the stimulus
# spectrogram as input and neural response (as firing rates / PSTH) as a target.
fitted_LN = LN_STRF.fit(spectrogram, response, output_name='pred')

# TODO: Set this up for a pre-fit LN model so that the plots actually look nice
#       without needing to run a long fit in the tutorial.
# Plot the output of each Layer in order, and compare the final output to
# the neural response.
